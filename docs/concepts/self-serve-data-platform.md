# Self-serve Data Platform

The driving force behind data mesh's evolution lies in the principle of self-serve data infrastructure as a platform. In a world with a vastness of data and analytics platforms, the actual goal is to revolutionize the scalability of sharing, accessing, and utilizing analytical data in a decentralized manner. This distinctive approach forms the foundamentals of a data mesh platform.

The main strategy involves extracting domain-agnostic capabilities from each domain and integrating them into a self-serve infrastructure platform. This platform is meticulously constructed and maintained by a dedicated central team, knonw as the *platform team*, ensuring efficacy and adaptability to ever-changing demands.

The aim of the platform team is to empower stream-aligned teams to operate with significant autonomy. While the stream-aligned teams retain complete ownership of developing, operating, and maintaining their applications in production, the platform team serves to offer internal services. These services are designed to alleviate the cognitive burden that product teams would otherwise face in developing these foundational services themselves.

A typical data mesh self-serve platform embodies several key characteristics:

* **Domain-oriented teams**: the platform is structured to empower autonomous teams aligned with specific domains. This approach fosters agility and specialization within each team, allowing them to focus on their unique domain expertise without being bogged down by centralized control.

* **Interoperable data products**: data products within the platform are designed to be interoperable, integrating code, data, and policy seamlessly into a single unit. This integration streamlines data management processes and enhances collaboration across different teams and domains.

* **Integrated operational and analytical capabilities**: traditionally, there has been a disconnect between operational and analytical worlds, interfering with fluid data utilization. Data mesh aims to bridge the gap by providing an integrated platform able to harmonize both operational and analytical capabilities.

* **Generalist data engineers**: the absence of standards amplifies interoperability challenges, often resulting in vendor lock-in within monolithic platforms. The data mesh paradigm seeks to break down these barriers by enhancing interoperability and reducing reliance on proprietary languages and technologies. By embracing common, generalist-friendly languages and tools, the platform empowers a broader range of data engineers to contribute effectively.

* **Decentralized technologies**: historically, infrastructure management has been centralized, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The data mesh paradigm advocates for decentralized technologies, distributing infrastructure management responsibilities across different teams and domains. This decentralization fosters scalability, resilience, innovation, while reducing dependency on centralized control.

* **Domain agnostic**: the platform offers domain-agnostic capabilities while enabling domain-specific modeling, processing, and sharing. This flexibility ensures that services remain centrally available while empowering individual domains to develop solutions tailored to their unique requirements. By hitting this balance between centralization and domain-specific customization, the platform accommodates diverse use cases promoting collaboration across the organization.

Such a decentralized structure allows greater flexibility, enabling teams to select and integrate the tools that best suit their specific needs and objectives.
