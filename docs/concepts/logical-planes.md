# Logical Planes

The platform can be logically divided in three planes:

1. [Mesh Experience Plane](./mesh-experience-plane.md): the platform marketplace, with the aim of discovering data products, managing access requests and interactions.
2. [Data Product Experience Plane](./data-product-experience-plane.md): the core component of the platform, this plane manages all the stages of data products lifecycle.
3. [Utility Plane](./utility-plane.md): the accessory plane that contains all the services and connectors between the Data Product Experience Plane and the actual infrastructure.
