# Utility Plane

The Utility Plane is the layer that decouples Open Data Mesh Platform, and in particular the [Data Product Experience Plane](./data-product-experience-plane.md), from the actual infrastructural layer. It offers standard interfaces to abstract the specific implementations of the services so that the platform doesn't need to know the dialect of each service. For each service offered by the utility plane, multiple adapters can be developed and utilized within the platform without affecting the other planes.
