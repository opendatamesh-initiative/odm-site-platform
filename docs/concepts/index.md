# Concepts

The *XOps Platform* is the core component that enables cross-functional domain teams and users to be autonomus in managing and consuming data products. The aim of this page is to be a landing for readers and to guide through the main concepts:

## Data Mesh paradigm

*Data Mesh* is a socio-technical paradigm that transforms how organizations manage and scale data. Instead of relying on a single central team, it empowers business domains to own their data as products, supported by self-serve platforms and guided by shared governance. The result: faster insights, higher quality, and data that truly serves the business

At its core, *Data Mesh* is built on four guiding pillars that unlock its full potential.

### Domain-oriented data ownership

### Data as a product

### Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform

### Federated computational governance
