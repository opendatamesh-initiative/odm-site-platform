# Overview

## What is ODMP
*Open Data Mesh Platform (ODMP)* is an open-source implementation of an *XOps Platform* facilitating the end-to-end management of data product lifecycle, from creation and validation, through deployment and access management, to decommissioning. 

ODMP's high versatility allows users to utilize the platform as is or tailor it to suit specific requirements. Embracing a modular architecture, ODMP leverages open specifications and protocols to enhance interoperability with diverse systems. By adhering to established standards, it fosters a supportive ecosystem of mesh tools that seamlessly integrate and adapt to evolving needs. Specifically, the platform is based on the [DPDS specification](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/) for defining data product metadata.

ODMP simplifies data-ops tasks, enabling teams to efficiently create, validate, deploy, make accessible and evolve their data products in a self-service manner empowering autonomous navigation. ODMP remains technology agnostic, providing flexibility to incorporate users' preferred tools through adapters.

The figure below provides a high-level view of the planes that compose the *Open Data Mesh Platform*.

If you want to deeply understand the [architecture](../architecture/index.md) and the implementation details of the Open Data Mesh Platform, this is the right place to start. You can also read the [Site Map](./sitemap.md) where you may find a structured index of all the documentation available on this site to plan your learning journey.

Welcome on board!

## Platform Capabilities

- **Data Product Blueprint Management** — APIs that register blueprints and seamlessly instantiate data products from a centralized repository

- **Data Product and Version Registration** — APIs that register and validate both high-level product metadata and detailed specifications for each version.

- **Computational Policy Verification** — APIs that codify global governance policies and ensure their enforcement throughout data product lifecycle events.

- **Data Product Deployment Management** — APIs that orchestrate CI/CD pipelines and manage end-to-end deployment of data products as architectural quanta through a single operation.

- **Data Product Lifecycle Event Notification** — APIs that automatically notify all registered observers about every key change in the data product lifecycle, streamlining integration with enterprise tools.

- **Data Marketplace Workflow Management** — APIs that orchestrate workflows controlling user access to data product outputs, ensuring smooth and secure marketplace operations.


> **Note:** The Open Data Mesh Platform isn’t meant to replace low-level infrastructure tools (like CI/CD pipeline logic). Instead, it provides a higher-level abstraction that orchestrates end-to-end data product processes, shielding users from the complexity of low-level tasks, whose implementation depends on the specifics of the underlying infrastructure technologies.


## Blindata Integration

> **ODMP + Blindata**: web UI, enterprise security, ontology management, and a powerful data marketplace — all in one platform.

The *Open Data Mesh Platform* seamlessly integrates with [Blindata](https://blindata.io/product/) — a complete suite of solutions for data governance and compliance. With Blindata, *ODMP* is elevated with an intuitive web interface, enterprise-grade security, powerful business ontology management, and streamlined data marketplace workflows. In fact, Blindata adds an *Experience Plane* on top of the platform, bringing the full power of *ODMP* closer to business users.

The following figure shows at a high level the layers that make up the enterprise setup of ODMP integrated with Blindata Platform.
