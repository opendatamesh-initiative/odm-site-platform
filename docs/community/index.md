# Community

We love your input! That is afterall the  main reason why we decieded to release the [DPDS specification](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/) and the [ODMP](../overview/index.md) as an open standard under Apache 2.0 licence.

    We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. We do not have anyway a formal contribution process like other open standard yet (ex. <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">AsyncAPI Specification Contribution Guide</a>). We want to define a lightweight process in the upcoming months collecting also your feedbacks on the different possibilities.

## Contributors

The ODM [DPDS specification](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/) was initially released by [Quantyca](https://www.quantyca.it/en). 

[Blindata](https://www.blindata.io) is currently the main contributor to the [ODMP](../overview/index.md).

We hope to on-board soon other organizations that want to help in mantaining and evolving both the specification and the platform.

## Open Data Mesh Initiative

We would like to create an initiative around the [DPDS specification](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/) and the [ODMP](../overview/index.md) to bring together all organizations and individuals who want to actively participate in its evolution, drive key technical decisions, and promote its adoption.  

If your organization or you as an individual are interested in joining this initiative, please [drop us an email](mailto:odm.info@quantyca.it) so we can arrange a presentation call.
