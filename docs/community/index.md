# Community

We love your input! That is afterall the  main reason why we decieded to relese the specification as an open standard under Apache 2.0 licence.

???+ warning
    We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. We do not have anyway a formal contribution process like other open standard yet (ex. <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">AsyncAPI Specification Contribution Guide</a>). We want to define a lightweight process in the upcoming months collecting also your feedbacks on the different possibilities.
